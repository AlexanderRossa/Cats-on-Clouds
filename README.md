Cats on Clouds is an interactive HTML Canvas App that demonstrates concepts of 2D Graphics such as drawing using Scene Graphs and using custom made Vectors and Matrix operations. At the time of the writing the App can be seen working at my portfolio page www.lucidfox.com - just open the modal 'Cats on Clouds' in the Portfolio section.

Assets used for meowing of cats were taken from the OrangeFreeSounds - http://www.orangefreesounds.com/ - thanks to the guys and gals over there for that.
